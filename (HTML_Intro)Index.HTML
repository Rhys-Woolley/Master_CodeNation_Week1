    <p>I became interested in Code Nation because I developed an interest in software <br>
    programming during my Level 3 BTEC in Tameside College. When leaving highschool, <br>
    you're asked the tricky question of what you want to do when you're older. Like <br>
    I'd imagine a lot of boys did, I wanted to be a game developer. At  the time I <br>
    had an idea in my head of what thatmeant that turned out to be something I'd <br>
    immediately be warned about going into College. It's not what you think it is. <br>
    "Game Developer" is just a fancy phrase for "Games Programmer", meaning it's software <br>
    programming that's made for the entertainment of users, in its simplest form. While <br>
    I wouldn't quite describe it it as a lifelong dream career or anything, I'm still <br>
    interested enough in the process of software programming and game design to want to <br>
    develop my knowlegde and ability with programming languages, and Code Nation offers <br>
    at least a few courses on the most commonly used and useful ones.

    <p>My primary flaw is getting information I learn to stick. In programming, it's apparently <br>
        not uncommon and a large part of working "in the field" is knowing how to research <br>
        your issue to quickly find a solution that likely already exists. This is certainly <br>
        something I'm going to focus on in terms of problem-solving, which I consider <br>
        myself to be good at, at least in terms of commitment and motivation. In a lot of <br>
        courses that involve some kind of project towards the end, what I have in mind <br>
        ends up being reliably underwhelming. This is almost definitely because I am <br>
        famously bad at planning. I much prefer to improvise and "solve" problems as they <br>
        come, but as you would expect there's a reason that's not taught in schools or any <br>
        other educatator. I'm the kind of person who usually gets new ideas and develops as <br>
        I go along, which is fine in some circumstances, but not when working on a coding <br>
        project with a time limit. For this course's project, I want to set myself the goal <br>
        of creating something that meets all the initial specifications I come up with at the <br>
        start of the planning stage. I don't want to be in a position where I say "I won't have <br>
        time to do that, we'll strike that one off the list" or cut anything out of the project <br>
        to get it into a functional state on presentation day. I want a fully functional, complete <br>
        project with all the bells and whistles.</p>
